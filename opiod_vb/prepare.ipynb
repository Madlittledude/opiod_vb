Critics of the Tobacco MSA note that while states continue to collect billions of\\ndollars from the tobacco settlements, only a small fraction of those funds are spent on\\nsmoking prevention and cessation programs.*\\n\\nThe structure of California's opioid settlements is intended to avoid such problems by\\nrequiring Participating Subdivisions receiving opioid settlement funds to spend these\\nfunds on opioid remediation activities. Funds are specifically intended to provide for\\nremediation of the opioid crisis, and efforts funded through settlement allocations\\nshould be geared toward prevention, treatment, recovery, and/or harm reduction.\\nOpioid remediation activities include those listed in Exhibit E of the settlement\\nagreements, and primarily include treatment and prevention, as well as additional\\n\\n' Opioid settlement funds in this instance refers to final and proposed agreements between\\nCalifornia and opioid distributors and manufacturers: McKesson, Cardinal Health and\\nAmerisourceBergen (collectively, the Distributors); Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc; Teva; Allergan;\\nand pharmacies Walmart, Walgreens, and CVS (collectively, the Pharmacies).\\n\\n2 Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, January 2023, “A State-by-State Look at the 1998 Tobacco\\nSettlement 24 Years Later.” Available at https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/what-we-\\n\\ndo/us/statereport/\\n\\nMarch 2023 | 1\\nstrategies such as planning, coordination, and research.

It is essential to build an organized, transparent, and sustainable process for how funds will be\\nallocated. Use the checklist below to integrate these planning steps into your process:\\n\\nta using the CDPH\\n\\n| dati\\n\\nO Review local data: We have looked at our\\ndashboard to prioritize funding towards our highest need communities.\\nFor example, some counties have disproportionate overdose rates within\\nspecific zip codes and among their black and tribal communities. Local\\nhealth departments and/or coalitions can provide these analyses, including\\ndata from ODMAP to monitor zip codes with spikes in overdose rates.\\nBased on the data, these are priorities in terms of location and\\ndemographics:\\n\\n0 Establish vision and purpose: We have outlined our overall vision and\\npurpose for our opioid settlement funds. Articulating a specific vision\\nstatement builds a common focus and commitment among partners. It is\\nalso an opportunity to align opioid settlement funds with other local\\ninitiatives and funding streams dedicated to substance use prevention and\\ntreatment.\\n\\n1 | © 2023, Public Health Institute.\\n\\nO Build partnerships (see part 2): We have a plan for conducting\\noutreach to local leaders and organizations doing existing work around\\nsubstance use prevention, treatment, and recovery to build a cohesive\\nfunding strategy. This includes local coalitions, public health departments,\\nbehavioral health departments, harm reduction organizations, and\\naddiction treatment providers. As a part of this step, it is important to\\nacknowledge any potential turf issues and challenges between local\\npartners and take time to build trust.\\n\\n0 Determine structure for decision-making and communications: We\\nhave established a written process and structure for how opioid settlement\\nfunds will be allocated. This includes documentation of who makes\\ndecisions, how decisions are made, and how those decisions are\\ncommunicated externally.\\n\\nConduct an “equity check”: We have identified a process to ensure\\nthat allocation of funds supports local organizations and interventions that\\nserve those most impacted by addiction and overdose. This includes\\ndirectly engaging those with lived and living experience and local leaders\\nwho represent communities of color, including Black, Indigenous and\\nLatinx.\\n\\nPHI CENTER FOR\\n\\nPUBLIC\\n\\nHEALTH\\nLEADERSHIP HEALTH\\n& IMPACT INSTITUTE®\\n\\nThank you!\\n\\nLet us know how we can\\nsupport your overdose\\nprevention efforts.\\n\\nContact us at\\ncopn@healthleadership.org\\n\\nFor more resources and to\\nsign up for our newsletter visit\\ncopn.org\\nCOPN is a project of PHI Center for\\nHealth Leadership & Impact.\\n\\n© 2023, California Department of\\nHealth Care Services.\\n\\nOVERDOSE:\\nPREVENTION |\\n\\nPHI CENTER FOR\\nHEALTH\\nLEADERSHIP\\n& IMPACT\\n\\nVINYOANVD\\n\\nNETWORK:\\n\\n¥ PUBLIC\\nHEALTH\\n\\nINSTITUTE®\\nQuestions?\\n\\n» Please type your questions into the question box in the right-hand corner\\nof your control panel.\\nFor more information on opioid settlement funds,\\nvisit the DHCS OSF webpage.\\n\\nFor additional questions email OSF@dhcs.ca.gov.\\n\\nPHCS\\n\\nCALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF\\nHEALTH CARE SERVICES', start_char_idx=12602, end_char_idx=15686, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The California J&D State-\\nSubdivision Agreements state:\\n\\n» “The California Department of Health Care Services (\"DHCS\"”) may add\\nto this list (but not delete from it) by designating additional High\\nImpact Abatement Activities. DHCS will make reasonable efforts to\\nconsult with stakeholders, including the CA Participating Subdivisions,\\nbefore adding additional High Impact Abatement Activities to this list.”\\n\\n» DHCS would like your input on whether to add purchasing naloxone to\\nCalifornia\\'s HIAA.\\n\\n20\\nWhat is Naloxone?\\n\\n» Naloxone is a life-saving medication that reverses an opioid\\noverdose. It works by blocking the opioid receptor sites and\\nreversing the toxic effects of an overdose. It can be administered by\\nintranasal spray, intramuscular (into the muscle), subcutaneous\\n(under the skin), or by intravenous injection.\\n\\n» There is little to no effect on an individual if opioids are not present\\nin their system. Naloxone has few known adverse effects and no\\npotential for abuse.\\nWhy is Naloxone Important?\\n\\n» Opioid overdoses are on the rise, and fentanyl is increasingly involved.\\n\\n» Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is up to 50 times stronger than\\nheroin\\n\\n» There were 7,175 opioid-related overdose deaths in California in 2021;\\n5,961 (or 83%) of these deaths were related to fentany!\\n\\n» By comparison, 48% of opioid overdose deaths in 2019 were fentanyl\\nrelated\\n\\n» Having naloxone available when encountering a suspected overdose can\\nsave a life.\\nPoll Question\\n\\n» Should purchasing naloxone be added to California\\'s High\\n\\nImpact Abatement Activities?\\n\\n» A yes vote means: | support adding naloxone to the list of California\\'s\\nHIAA. This means that Participating Subdivisions would be able to\\nspend up to 100% of their J&D allocation on purchasing naloxone.\\n\\n» Ano vote means: | do not support adding naloxone to the list of\\nCalifornia\\'s HIAA. This means that Participating Subdivisions would only\\nbe able to spend up to 50% of their J&D allocation on purchasing\\nnaloxone.\\nAudience Response Question\\n\\n» Do you have concerns about adding naloxone to\\nCalifornia\\'s High Impact Abatement Activities?\\n\\n» Please type your response in the question box.\\nConsiderations & Resources\\n\\na\\nConsiderations for Use of J&.D', start_char_idx=7012, end_char_idx=10507, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

      "Examples of drugs that can be used to treat opioid addiction include methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. Methadone is a long-acting opioid agonist that works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and blocking the effects of other opioids. Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist that works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and reducing the effects of other opioids. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that works by blocking opioid receptors in the brain and preventing the effects of other opioids.\n",
