Allowable expenditures must include activities tied to the ending, reduction or lessening
the effects of the opioid epidemic in communities and include prevention, intervention,
harm reduction, treatment and recovery services. After reviewing the list, if you have
questions about the applicability of your strategy to expend these funds, send questions

to DHCS at OSF@dhcs.ca.gov.

The following information is intended to provide Participating Subdivisions with a list of
allowable expenditures for the J&D settlement funds and includes two sections:
