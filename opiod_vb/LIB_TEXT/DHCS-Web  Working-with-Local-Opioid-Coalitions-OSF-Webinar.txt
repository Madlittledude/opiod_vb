VINYOsITV>

* Develop a strategy: opioid settlement funding presents a
pivotal opportunity to invest in evidence-based programs
that save lives. Take the time to engage local leaders and
build a cohesive and transparent strategy.

* Support existing programs: Connect with local partners
doing the work to avoid reinventing the wheel. Programs in
your community already exist that:

* Have been shown to be effective

* Meet the needs of California's high abatement activities

* Can be further invested in to increase their reach and
Impact

* Support a return on investment (ROI) for local budgets

* Align funding streams: Build efficiencies by ‘blending and
braiding’ settlement funds with other local funding streams
focused on substance use prevention and treatment.

NETWORK:

Funding from opioid settlements presents a critical opportunity to invest in evidence-based programs focused on prevention, treatment, recovery, and harm
reduction. As stewards of this funding, it is important to develop a strategic approach and organized process on how resources will be allocated in your

community to best meet local needs and align with existing efforts.

This tool is designed to help your community develop an organized strategy to maximize local investment and, most importantly, save as many lives as
possible. This includes developing a coordinated and transparent process, connecting to existing programs, identifying necessary partners, and prioritizing

strategies.

Part 1 - Develop a Coordinated and Transparent Process

Settlement funds will be available for at least 18 years. It is essential to build an organized, transparent, and sustainable process for how funds will be
allocated. Use the checklist below to integrate these planning steps into your process:

ta using the CDPH

| dati

O Review local data: We have looked at our
dashboard to prioritize funding towards our highest need communities.
For example, some counties have disproportionate overdose rates within
specific zip codes and among their black and tribal communities. Local
health departments and/or coalitions can provide these analyses, including
data from ODMAP to monitor zip codes with spikes in overdose rates.
Based on the data, these are priorities in terms of location and
demographics:

0 Establish vision and purpose: We have outlined our overall vision and
purpose for our opioid settlement funds. Articulating a specific vision
statement builds a common focus and commitment among partners. It is
also an opportunity to align opioid settlement funds with other local
initiatives and funding streams dedicated to substance use prevention and
treatment.

1 | © 2023, Public Health Institute.

O Build partnerships (see part 2): We have a plan for conducting
outreach to local leaders and organizations doing existing work around
substance use prevention, treatment, and recovery to build a cohesive
funding strategy. This includes local coalitions, public health departments,
behavioral health departments, harm reduction organizations, and
addiction treatment providers. As a part of this step, it is important to
acknowledge any potential turf issues and challenges between local
partners and take time to build trust.

0 Determine structure for decision-making and communications: We
have established a written process and structure for how opioid settlement
funds will be allocated. This includes documentation of who makes
decisions, how decisions are made, and how those decisions are
communicated externally.

Conduct an “equity check”: We have identified a process to ensure
that allocation of funds supports local organizations and interventions that
serve those most impacted by addiction and overdose. This includes
directly engaging those with lived and living experience and local leaders
who represent communities of color, including Black, Indigenous and
Latinx.
