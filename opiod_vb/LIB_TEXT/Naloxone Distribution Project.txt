(FDA) approved Narcan, a 4 milligram (mg) naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray, for over-the-counter

(OTC), nonprescription use on March 29, 2023. This action paves the way for the live-saving
medication to reverse an opioid overdose to be sold directly to consumers. The timeline for
availability and price of the OTC product is determined by the manufacturer. The FDA will work with
all stakeholders to help facilitate the continued availability of naloxone nasal spray products during
Narcan's transition from prescription to OTC status, which may take months. The FDA hosted a
stakeholder call to share information on expanding access to naloxone on March 30, 2023. Click here

Other formulations and dosages of naloxone will remain available by prescription only. There are no
changes to California's Naloxone Distribution Project (NDP) as a result of the FDA decision at this
time. DHCS is monitoring the progress of OTC Narcan closely and will provide more updates as they

become available.
